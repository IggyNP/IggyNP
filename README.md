# Hi there 👋

### Welcome to my profile!

- 🌱 I’m currently learning C at [42 Málaga](https://www.42malaga.com/). Check my [Piscine repository](https://github.com/IggyNP/42-Piscine-C) out and learn more about it.
- ⚡ Fun facts:
  - I love blockchain technology. Been involved with NFTs in Solana, attending exclusive IRL parties for holders only, 
  and even was the community manager for one project at some point (fun times).
  - I have a business and marketing background:
     - MBA in International Management.
     - Masters Degree in Digital Marketing & E-Commerce.
     - Co-founder of 🍻 [Cerveza Marbella](https://www.instagram.com/cervezamarbella/).
  - Crossfitter. Don't be offended by my pullups if you're a gym brogrammer.
  - Lofi hip-hop addict. 🐱
